### Routing Application
This application is designed to be used with zolertia re-mote. It consists of a routing.c file that must be flashed onto the remote device and a user interface (UI) that is used to control the networking process.

To use the application, first open the MainWindow_file and run Main. When the start button is pressed, the application will indicate that it is ready for a connection. At this point, you should connect a mote to your target computer. Once the mote is connected, you can press the other button to begin the networking process.

Please note that proper setup and configuration of the mote and remote device is required for the application to function correctly.

### Getting Started
Flash the routing.c file onto the zolertia re-mote device
Open the MainWindow_file and run Main on your target computer
Connect a mote to your target computer
Press the start button on the UI and wait for the application to indicate that it is ready for a connection
Press the other button to begin the networking process.
